Artifacts
=========

.. artifact:: ubc needs.json file
   :id: ART_UBC_NEEDS_JSON

   A json file containing Sphinx-Needs objects.

   Often used to share requirements and co. in a technical way without
   the whole documentation project.

   Created by :need:`TOOL_UBC`, 
   which result is totally independant from :need:`TOOL_SN`.
