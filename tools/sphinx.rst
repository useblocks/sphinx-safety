Features
--------


.. feature:: Read-in documents with Sphinx
   :id: FE_SPHINX_READ
   :tools: TOOL_SPHINX

   Readin all needed rst/md files for the Sphinx project.

   .. error:: Needed folders/files are ignored
      :id: ER_FILES_IGNORED
      :td: 1 

      Error is logged by Sphinx and with build-option ``-W``
      this warning gets thrown as error and stops the build.

   .. error:: Needed files/folders have not supported encoding
      :id: ER_SPH_WRONG_ENCODING
      :td: 1
   
   .. error:: Access to files/folders not given
      :id: ER_SPH_WRONG_ACCESS
      :td: 1



Restrictions
------------

.. restriction:: Warning to Error
   :id: RE_SPHINX_WARNINGS
   :avoids: ER_FILES_IGNORED, ER_SPH_WRONG_ENCODING, ER_SPH_WRONG_ACCESS

   Always use the sphinx-build option ``-W`` to transform all warnings into errors,
   because only errors stop the build and set an exit code > 0.

.. restriction:: Clean full build 
   :id: RE_SPHINX_CLEAN
   
   Always use a **clean** and **full** sphinx-build.
   An incremental build is not allowed, as not all files get updated by Sphinx.

   So before the ``sphinx-build`` command gets executed, the related ``build`` folder shall be deleted.
   Then ``sphinx-build`` shall be built with the options ``-a`` and ``-E`` to force Sphinx
   to read and write really all files.
