Basic Principles
-----------------

1. Validate only relevant use cases.
2. If a tool error is negligible compared to human error, validation is not required.
3. Use comparisons between diverse tools as part of the argumentation.
4. Reuse community tests wherever reasonable.
5. There is no such thing as "proven in use" for newer tool versions.

Classification & Qualification Model
------------------------------------

The following flowchart provides an overview of all available Sphinx-Needs types and their relationships.

.. image:: /_static/sphinx-safety_classi_qualification.drawio.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 99%

This classification documentation focuses on the blue elements:

* Use cases
* Features
* Errors
* Restrictions
* Tools

The remaining elements are part of the :ref:`qualification`.

An example of this data model with real elements is shown below:

.. image:: /_static/contribute_model_example.png
   :align: center

Each Sphinx-Needs object has several attributes, as illustrated in the following class diagram.

Calculated attributes are marked with a red square, while manual ones are marked with a green circle.

.. uml::

   class "Use Case" as uc {
      __Defaults__
      +title: string
      +id: string
      +content: string
      +status: string
      __Specific__
      +TI: integer
      -TCL: integer
      ..Links..
      +tools <<tool>>
      +features <<feature>>
      +inputs <<artifact>>
      +outputs <<artifact>>
   }

   class "Tool" as to {
      __Defaults__
      +title: string
      +id: string
      +content: string
      +status: string
      __Specific__
      +version: string
   }

   class "Feature" as fe {
      __Defaults__
      +title: string
      +id: string
      +content: string
      +status: string
      __Specific__
      -TD: integer
      ..Links..
      +tools <<tool>>
      -child needs <<error>>
      +inputs <<artifact>>
      +outputs <<artifact>>
   }
   
   class "Error" as er {
      __Defaults__
      +title: string
      +id: string
      +content: string
      +status: string
      __Specific__
      +TD: integer
   }

   class "Restriction" as re {
      __Defaults__
      +title: string
      +id: string
      +content: string
      +status: string
      __Specific__
      ..Links..
      +avoids <<error>>
   }

   uc -> fe
   fe --> er
   re --> er
   uc --> to
   fe --> to

Extend Documentation
--------------------

For this documentation, the workflow described in :ref:`usage` is the preferred approach.

After making changes and testing them locally with a Sphinx build, create a Pull Request (PR) in the repository.

The PR will be automatically checked, and the documentation will be built in a test run. Afterward, a manual review will be conducted.

Once the review is approved and all CI tests pass, the PR will be merged, and the updated documentation will be deployed.

TI, TD, and TCL Values
-----------------------

The **Tool Impact (TI)** value is assigned at the ``use case`` level and indicates whether the ``use case`` has a safety-relevant impact:

- **TI = 2**: Indicates a safety-relevant impact.
- **TI = 1**: Indicates no safety relevance.

.. hint::
   
   The **TI** level is very project-specific. For instance in one project requirements are used to describe an Airbag system
   for a car, in another project there are used for minor parts of the multimedia system.

   This documentation always have the "worst case" in mind, which means that the target documentation is the single source
   of truth for a high safety critical project.


The **Tool Error Detection (TD)** value must be defined for each ``error`` and represents the ability to detect the error:

- **TD = 1**: The error is detected, and execution stops without producing a final result.
- **TD = 3**: The error is not detected.
- **TD = 2**: This value is not used in this document.

The final **Tool Confidence Level (TCL)** is calculated as follows:

- If **TI = 1**, then **TCL = 1**, and no further actions are required for tool qualification.
- If **TI = 2**, the highest **TD** value among all linked, safety-relevant features and their errors determines the **TCL**.
- A **tbd** (to  be done) can be set, if the final TCL can onyl be set after missing features and co. are added.

A ``use case`` with a **TCL** of **2** or **3** requires special handling during the tool qualification process.
